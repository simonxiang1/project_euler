# My Project Euler Solutions

I'm using this repository to get better at shell scripting while simultaneously doing fun math problems! Currently I write my solutions in POSIX compliant shell scripts (think bash, zsh, ksh) and C.

I try to find the most efficient algorithm for each problem. If you check the comments of my code, I'll write in Big O notation the algorithm's complexity: e.g. for Problem 1, I have two solutionsâ€” one runs in O(n) time (linear) while the other runs in O(1) time (constant).
